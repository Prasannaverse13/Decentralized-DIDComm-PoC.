# Decentralized DIDComm PoC

# Project Description:

The "Decentralized DIDComm PoC" is a Proof of Concept (PoC) implementation that explores the decentralized capabilities of the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and the DID Communication (DIDComm) protocol. The project aims to showcase the potential of decentralized identity management and secure communication in a distributed network.

# Project Objectives:

Decentralized Identity Management: Implement a decentralized identity management system using DIDs, allowing users to have control over their identity without relying on a central authority.

DIDComm Protocol Implementation: Develop a functional implementation of the DIDComm protocol, enabling secure and private communication between decentralized identities.

Secure Key Exchange: Implement a secure key exchange mechanism to facilitate secure communication channels between users in a decentralized network.

Proof of Concept (PoC) Application: Build a PoC application that demonstrates the decentralized identity and communication capabilities using the implemented DIDComm protocol.

Interoperability: Ensure interoperability by adhering to established standards and protocols, fostering compatibility with other decentralized identity solutions.

Scalability and Performance: Evaluate the scalability and performance of the decentralized DIDComm implementation to assess its viability for real-world, large-scale applications.

# Technologies Used:

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): A new type of identifier for verifiable, self-sovereign digital identities.

DID Communication (DIDComm) Protocol: A secure communication protocol for interoperable and privacy-preserving communication between decentralized identities.

Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT): Utilize a DLT platform, such as blockchain, for storing decentralized identity information and ensuring immutability.

Cryptographic Libraries: Implement cryptographic functions for secure key exchange and authentication.

Programming Languages: Use languages such as Java or Python for the implementation of the PoC.

# Expected Deliverables:

Decentralized Identity Management Module: A module allowing users to create and manage their decentralized identities.

DIDComm Protocol Implementation: A functional implementation of the DIDComm protocol for secure communication.

PoC Application: A demonstrative application showcasing the decentralized identity and communication features.

Documentation: Comprehensive documentation detailing the design, implementation, and usage of the decentralized DIDComm PoC.

# Benefits:

Enhanced Privacy: Users have greater control over their identity, enhancing privacy and reducing reliance on central authorities.

Interoperable Communication: Establish secure communication channels between users, regardless of the underlying decentralized identity solution.

Use Case Exploration: The PoC provides a foundation for exploring potential use cases for decentralized identity and communication in various domains.

Community Engagement: Encourage collaboration and contributions from the decentralized identity community to improve and extend the project.
